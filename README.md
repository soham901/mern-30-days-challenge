## MERN Stack 30 Days Challenge

This repository documents my journey through the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) during a **30-day challenge**. Follow along as I learn, build, and share my progress each day!

<br />

**What is the MERN stack?**

MERN is a powerful combination of JavaScript technologies to build modern web applications. Each component plays a crucial role:

- **MongoDB:** Provides a flexible NoSQL database for storing and managing data.
- **Express.js:** A lightweight Node.js framework for building API endpoints.
- **React.js:** A popular JavaScript library for creating dynamic and user-friendly user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side.

<br />

**Challenge Structure:**

This challenge is divided into 30 days, each focusing on a specific aspect of the MERN stack. Every day includes:

- **Instructions:** Clear and concise steps to guide you through the day's topic.
- **Resources:** Links to relevant articles, tutorials, and documentation.
- **Exercises:** Practical challenges to test your understanding and apply your new skills.

<br />

**Current Progress:**

As of today, **January 22, 2024**, I have completed **Day 6** of the challenge. You can find my progress documented in the following folders:

- **Day 1:** Introduction to MERN stack
- **Day 2:** Setting up MongoDB and Node.js
- **Day 3:** Basic CRUD operations with MongoDB
- **Day 4:** Introduction to Express.js
- **Day 5:** Building simple APIs with Express.js
- **Day 6:** Getting started with React.js
- **Day 7:** Form Handling and Validation with React.js
  <br />
